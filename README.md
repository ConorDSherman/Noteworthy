<h1>Noteworthy</h1>
<h4><i>A PHP-Based Blogging Tool <span style="font-size:50%">for use with</span> Evernote</i></h4>

The Following is a list of notes regarding the use and configuration of Noteworthy.

<h2>General Requirements</h2>
You will need:
<ul>
	<li>a web server running PHP 5.0 or higher</li>
	<li>MySQL 5.0 or higher</li>
</ul>

<h2>Optional Components</h2>
There are some optional pieces to the puzzle that might make things a little better. These things include:
<ul>
	<li>something to drink</li>
	<li>good music</li>
	<li>a faithful dog</li>
</ul>

<h2>Considerations</h2>
The use of a database is a requirement at the moment. In future releases, the MySQL component will be optional.

<h2>Quick Notes</h2>
Noteworthy will create any missing directories that it needs, so please ensure the files and directories are owned by Apache (or whichever user is the web server). No directory should be 777. 755 is plenty sufficient for this project.
