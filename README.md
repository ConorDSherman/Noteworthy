<h1>Noteworthy</h1>
<h4><i>A PHP-Based Blogging Tool for Evernote</i></h4>

The Following is a list of notes regarding the use and configuration of Noteworthy.

<h2>General Requirements</h2>
You will need:
<ul>
	<li>a web server running PHP 5.0 or higher</li>
</ul>

<h2>Optional Components</h2>
There are some optional pieces to the puzzle that might make things a little better for your website. These things include:
<ul>
	<li>MySQL 5.0 or higher</li>
</li>

<h2>Considerations</h2>
The use of a database is completely optional. The advantages, though, are quite stark. By using a MySQL backend people will be able to directly search all content on the site, including different Types of content (Blog Posts/Tweets/etc.) without relying on a 3rd party service like Google Search. It will also be possible to hold onto previous versions of notes, and more dynamically display extra pieces of data, such as Previous/Next items.

Of course the goal is to have both MySQL and Non-MySQL versions on par in terms of performance and features.
